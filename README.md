# WBank

## Project Description: When I was in my SQL class I had to create a database and call it WBank. 

## Project Tasks
  - **Task 1: Set up the database**
    - Make sure Microsoft SQL Server is installed on your computer
    - Organize your classes and make sure you have everything together
    **Task 2: Make the Database**
    - Use an If, alter, and drop statement so that you can make constant changes to the database
      without having to rewrite the entire program
    - Use the create DDL function to name and start your database
    **Task 3: Create your tables**
    - After you create the database, make your tables. 
    - Establish the primary and foreign keys for this program
    **Task 4: Insert Values**
    - Use the Insert INTO function to insert new values into the database.
    **Task 5: Execute the funtion**
    - Execute the funtion then test it to make sure all the tables and objects work.
